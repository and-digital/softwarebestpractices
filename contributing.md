Software Best Practices is a community-driven project. This site is generated from a public Git repository: [https://github.com/and-digital/softwarebestpractices](https://github.com/and-digital/softwarebestpractices)

## How to contribute
To contribute a guide into [SoftwareBestPractices.com](https://softwarebestpractices.com), you should fork the repository and create a pull request into [and-digital/softwarebestpractices](https://github.com/and-digital/softwarebestpractices)
 on GitHub.

Guides live in the `_guides/` directory under the code repository. Copy an existing guide to understand the structure and syntax.

The part between `---` and `---` at the top of the document is called a _Front Matter_. The Front Matter is used to define variables that are used by our site generation software [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The rest of the document should be written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
