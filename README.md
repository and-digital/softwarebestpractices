# Welcome

*Software Best Practices* is an opinionated collection of guides, tutorials and recipes on how to build and deliver great software.

Our primary focus is in modern web application development, but many of the principles can be applied to other areas of software engineering.

The project is managed by AND Digital, one of the fastest growing digital agencies in the United Kingdom.
